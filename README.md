No installation is required. Our project takes the form of an unhosted website of PHP files.
To view PHP files, you need a local host software such as XAAMP. You will also need a copy of our database file. 
After downloading the project files, open the CustomerLogin.php file 
Login with your existing user, or create a new one. This will lead you to the customer pages.
To access the supplier side, simply log out and choose the supplier login, making a seperate supplier account if you do not already have one.
